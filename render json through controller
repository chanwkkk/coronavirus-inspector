render json through controller
connect the frontend to backend
add validation
add seeds in database
no restaurant introduction but plain food intro 
set up login? a:b page



after implement JWT, I will want to implement a jumboron, kind of working on the user interface


set up signup route and reducer
set up myOrder component and myFavorite component
rendering dish list for the above two component
add button for order and cancel dishes(create order reducers)
add loading? a:b page
ADD PICTURE FOR SEEDS FILE



To create a userContainer: which includes: loginpage and order container 
questions!!! how to persist user_id to the page so even you refresh it, you are still logged in? (anyways,
 so far, I will not use a persist, so once you refresh you will have to reinput the user information)

set up a route in the backend for people to signup and login
and the async operation in the frontend will give be responsible to display whether you login or not 
.then(........login or not ? a:b)(once I post username and password correctly there and get a succesful login message
the backend should render a user information when I can use to fill up my order component)

Error message!!!
However, once I got a no-match response, I should add a component call errorDisplay block, and render the error message 
or alert error message(will be better!!!)there




write reducer and action
finish reading the whole react-bootstrap doc and start to apply it to my project





URL: 

post /users  --create users
get /users/:id  --check all the information

get /menu(direct to /dishes) --render menu component

post user_id/favorites --add favorites to list
get user_id//favorites --check all your favorite list
get user_id//favorites/:id  -- check a certain favorite list

get user_id//orders check previous orders
post user_id//orders/:id --submit your own order and change the order status to submit succesfully and waited to be served

     


improve myself : selenium- learn web scraping


ABOUT THE BLOG, I CAN WRITE LIKE CLIENT-SIDE AUTHENTICATION/REACT-bootstrap JWT

on the user_params problem, I just permit everything instead of require a user class

serializer and action too much repetition!!!!!!!
I want to go through the JWT first, after that, I will decide if I want to ask signup route to share the same form as login, but pass a different
handleSubmit method there
